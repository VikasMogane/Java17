//JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline
//Apple deprecated the OpenGL rendering library in macOS 10.14 release(September 2018), in favor of the new Metal framework for better performance.
//This JEP changes the Java 2D (like Swing GUI) internal rendering pipeline for macOS from Apple OpenGL API to Apple Metal API; this is an internal change; there are no new Java 2D APIs, nor change any existing APIs.


//JEP 391: macOS/AArch64 Port
//Apple has a long-term plan to transition its Mac from x64 to AArch64 (e.g., Apple M1 processors).
//This JEP port JDK to run on AArch64 platforms on macOS.
